# Referee FYI

Digital anomaly log for Head Referees in VRC, VIQRC, and VEX U. Referee FYI allows you to record violations quickly, see summaries before a match, and share your log with others.

- Record match anomaly logs by match and see citations by team, including summaries for each match.

- Works offline* and stores all data locally on-device. The intention here is that your phone doesnâ€™t need to be continuously connected

- Built-in sharing system that allows users to synchronize anomaly log entries across multiple devices
