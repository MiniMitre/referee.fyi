# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Referee FYI. Read this guide for an
overview of how to get started! For an overview of the project, see the
[`README`](https://github.com/brenapp/referee.fyi)

## Design Principles & Goals

Referee FYI is designed to be a progressive web app that is primarily intended
to be used for mobile devices. We anticipate that many of the referees using
this application will be situated in facilities with poor internet connections.
We also anticipate that some users may need to install and join a share instance
quickly after learning about the application for the first time that day. These
constraints drive a lot of our technical decisions:

1. Referee FYI should be available from the web, and quick to install even on
   bad internet connections. We should strive for the entire application to be
   less than 5 MB, so it can be easily installed from poor internet during an
   event.
2. Once installed, Referee FYI should make no assumptions about network
   connectivity. Obviously, we depend on the Internet for RobotEvents data and
   for the sharing server (if used). But the user should be able to perform all
   actions, even when offline, and the application should reconcile those
   changes when connectivity is restored. This includes strong caching for
   RobotEvents data.
3. Referee FYI should design first for small, touch friendly devices, even at
   the expense of the desktop.
4. Referee FYI should protect incident data very carefully. The safest place
   incident data can be is on the user's device.
5. Sharing content between devices must be quick, reliable, and automatic. Users
   must trust that they are seeing the entire set of data at all times, whenever
   possible.

### Non Goals

1. Referee FYI does not replace Tournament Manager, RobotEvents, or TM Mobile.
   We are aiming to replace the paper anomaly log. 
2. Data should be isolated between events. We should not present information
   about a team that comes from outside the event we are running now, as this
   can reinforce fairness issues; every event should be a clean slate.

## Technologies

This project makes use of the following technologies extensively.

- React 
- Tailwind
- Tanstack Query
- Vite
- Cloudflare Workers

## App Structure

The general structure of Referee FYI is motivated by creating a Progressive Web
App that end users can add to their home screen on their phone. The client
application is a static react app hosted using Cloudflare Pages to provide
low-latency throughout the world. The sharing service make use of Cloudflare
Workers to provide efficient, edge web services to reduce latency between mobile
devices and the share server.

> Edge Services. Cloudflare Workers is really well adapted to this project
> because the vast majority of cloud interactions we care about (sync actions
> with the sync service) happen between devices that all are located in the same
> facility. Since Cloudflare distributes the sync worker across all of its
> datacenters, it can provide low latency (>20ms TTFB) communication around the
> world, and requires little synchronization between data centers.

## Initial Setup

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org) LTS.

After you checkout, run `npm i` to install all dependencies, including build
tooling.

```
cd referee.fyi
npm i
```

### `.env` Setup

Additionally, you'll want to create a `.env.local` file to populate environment
variables into Vite when running the development server locally. Each
environment variable is explained below.

```
VITE_REFEREE_FYI_SHARE_SERVER=https://staging.share.referee.fyi
```

Specifies the share server URL to use when connecting. For most development that
does not touch the sharing server, you should use the staging server (listed
above).


```
VITE_REFEREE_FYI_BUILD_MODE=STANDARD
```

The build mode is used to enable some features for the worlds build, changing
how the sharing mechanism works, displaying additional information, and
disabling some features. For most cases, you should keep it `STANDARD`

```
VITE_REFEREE_FYI_ENABLE_SENTRY=false
```

Enable [Sentry](https://sentry.io) reporting in this environment. You should set
this to no.

```
VITE_ROBOTEVENTS_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
```

The bearer token used to authenticate with the RobotEvents API to fetch data.
You should request a token from [here](https://robotevents.com/api/v2) and
supply it here.

```
VITE_LOGSERVER_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
```

The token to use when submitting dumps to the LogServer (Brendan's
project-agnostic system dump service). Contact Brendan to get a token.

```
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
```

Token to use when submitting issues to Sentry's error reporting system.

> **Why do we have both Sentry and LogServer?** Partially historical, partial
> practical. The logserver is used to submit dumps of the current state of the
> application, including all locally stored. This is done intentionally by the
> end user (via the submit feedback form) and includes a ton more data about the
> user's session, including the contents of all locally stored data. Sentry is
> for automatic reporting of issues without user intervention.

## Application Development

Once you have dependencies installed, run a local instance of Referee FYI in
development mode. This should prompt you to visit `http://localhost:3000` (or
another URL), and includes watch mode for both `src` (application content) and
`lib` (shared libraries between server and client).

```
npm run dev
```


## Share Server Development
For most development, you should probably use the staging sync server at
`https://staging.share.referee.fyi`, but if you 


### [Optional] Secure Share Server Development Locally
If you wish to develop for the sync service locally, and have a mechanism
allowing you to use HTTPS on your local network (this can be useful when testing
multi-device setup), you can instruct Wrangler to use particular HTTPS
certificates for the Sync Service by running `npm run `
