### 7 Jan 2024

- Add edit functionality for existing incidents. 
- Add general notes to incidents, which do not count in rule summaries. General notes are intended
  for situations where the referee wants to note something about the team without it necessarily
  being a violation (ex: team was 2 minutes late for match, or team showed good sportsmanship)
- Added skills-only page for multi-division events to make it easier to enter incidents
- Fix bug where incidents could not be created from the team page
- Performance improvements and bug fixes

### 18 Jan 2024

- You are now able to share your anomaly log with other users from the Manage tab of an event.
  Connected devices will sync their anomaly log in real-time with other active users. Note that
  anyone with access to the share code in the manage tab will be able to read and write to the
  shared log, so treat this code with caution.

- Improve Match Dialog UI to include a full list of each team's violation, as well as a rule-by-rule summary.

- Performance improvements and bug fixes

### Initial Release

- Select your event from the list of events on today, or enter the SKU directly from RobotEvents.
- Once Tournament manager has set up the match schedule, you will be able to see each of the matches in a list, and can select the teams in that match to record violations.
